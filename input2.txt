Paragraph from Wikipedia:
A volcanic eruption is a process in which magma erupts from cracks in the Earth's crust to the surface, forming volcanoes.
Molten rocks originating in the Earth's mantle accumulate in a magma chamber, rise into a conduit due to high pressure and temperature,
and are ejected through the volcano's mouth or a system of cracks on its slopes. There are different types of volcanic eruptions,
and they differ from each other in the intensity, composition and amount of materials ejected, as well as in the structures formed.
Volcanic eruptions occur mainly at the boundaries between tectonic plates - huge lithospheric surfaces extending under the continents
and oceans - such as the Ring of Fire and mid-ocean ridges. Volcanic activity also occurs at hotspots - permanent intraplate
areas - creating chains of volcanic islands and volcanoes, such as the Hawaiian Islands and the volcanic mounds in the Golan Heights.
